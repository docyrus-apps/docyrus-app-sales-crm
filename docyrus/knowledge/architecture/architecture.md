## Defensive Relation Rendering

Relation and enum fields can resolve to `null`. UI code must guard for both object shape and nullability before reading nested `.name` properties, especially in dashboard cards and summary lists.

## Root Runtime Tooling

The React root mounts Docyrus auth, TanStack Query, and Docyrus Devtools together. Devtools should receive the shared `queryClient`, and auth-managed API clients should be registered from inside the auth provider tree.
